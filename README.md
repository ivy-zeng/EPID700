## *Systematic Review of HIPAA and Privacy Regulations in Correctional Facilities with a Focus on HIV-Positive Inmates*

Ivy Zeng

## Abstract
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act is a federal law that was signed into law in 1996. The purpose of this is to ensure the safety and privacy of sensitive health information from being disclosed without the knowledge of the patient. This is also made true in correctional facilities. Inmates have the same HIPAA rights as civilians, like the minimum necessary standard. Covered entities under HIPAA include any health plan, healthcare clearinghouse, or healthcare provider communicating Protected Health Information (PHI) electronically. This paper will review the privacy regulations in correctional facilities and the stigma surrounding HIV. I describe how the minimum necessary utilizes protected health information for intended purposes and under what circumstances law enforcement can receive protected health information. In addition, I will focus on the stigma surrounding HIV-positive inmates and how the segregation of HIV-positive inmates is a breach of confidentiality. Methods used are MeSH search on the National Library of Medicine to identify papers that present data on privacy regulations in prison. We will also use a public dataset on staff stigma attitudes surrounding HIV in correctional facilities and create pie charts displaying results. 

## Introduction 
Healthcare within correctional facilities presents unique challenges between law enforcement, healthcare, and individual privacy. As the United States deals with one of the highest incarceration rates <sup>1</sup>, the need to balance between maintaining the security of correctional institutions and upholding the fundamental right to healthcare privacy has become increasingly critical. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), enacted in 1996, established a framework for safeguarding individuals' medical information in various healthcare settings. However, applying HIPAA regulations within correctional facilities presents a complex and evolving area of concern. HIV segregation in prison systems is known as discrimination and a breach of confidentiality. Not only is it a violation of human rights, but it also breaks the US guidelines for the management of HIV in prison.<sup>9</sup>

## Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)
In 1996, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act was signed into law to protect the exchange of health information. This allowed patients to control who they released their personal health information to.<sup>2</sup> This is important because we want to safeguard our sensitive data. Organizations that do not comply with HIPAA will face penalties, motivating them to ensure privacy. This law creates a standard for all organizations that handle sensitive medical records. The privacy rule, enacted in 2000, sets a standard for protected health information (PHI). In the privacy rule,  an inmate hospital is not required to get authorization or consent before using or disclosing an inmate’s PHI for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations.<sup>4</sup>
Then in 2003, the Privacy Rule became effective allowing patients the right to personal health information and understand how their information is being used.<sup>3</sup>The privacy rule also allowed “covered entities” to disclose and share PHI electronically with transactions, however, this cannot be done without the patient’s authorization. HIPAA could easily be broken by simply entering the incorrect patient’s chart or separating patients based on diagnosis. The practice of separating HIV-positive inmates has been abolished since 2013 with South Carolina being the last state to do so. This act unintentionally discloses the status of inmates without their consent. With the increase in electronic health record use, we need to be careful in how we transmit medical records.


## Covered Entities
Covered Entities, a crucial part of the privacy rule, are organizations or individuals subjected to follow HIPAA laws. These organizations include healthcare providers, health plans, insurance, and healthcare clearinghouses transmitting electronic health information. A decision tool is offered to help determine if an individual or organization is considered a covered entity.<sup>5</sup> Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services provides this tool for those who are not sure if they fall under covered entities. The decision tool contains questions like “Does the person, business, or agency furnish, bill, or receive payment for health care in the normal course of business?” and “Does the business or agency process, or facilitate the processing of, health information from nonstandard format or content into standard format or content or from standard format or content into nonstandard format or content?”<sup>8</sup>

## HIPAA-Covered Entities:
1.	Use or Disclosure of PHI:
* Covered entities may use or disclose PHI for treatment, payment, or health-care operations without requiring individual authorization, except for specific disclosures.
2.	Required Risk Assessment:
* Covered entities are required to conduct a risk assessment to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities to electronic PHI and implement security measures.
3.	When Consent Is Not Required:
* HIPAA permits covered entities to transmit PHI without consent in specific situations, such as treatment, public health activities, court orders, subpoenas, and law enforcement purposes.<sup>5</sup>

## Principle of Minimum Necessity
The principle of Minimum Necessity is known as the standard for protecting PHI and requires covered entities to make an effort to limit the request of PHI to only what is necessary after receiving permission.<sup>7</sup> 

* An exception exists for health-care providers sharing information for treatment, at the request of the HHS Secretary, for reasons required by law, or when sharing information with the individual who is the patient or consumer.<sup>7</sup> 
* HIPAA and 42 CFR Part 2 establish a minimum standard for protecting and securing PHI.
* HIPAA, 42 CFR Part 2, and state laws have provisions allowing courts to obtain health-care information from covered entities in response to a judicial order.
* Covered entities are instructed to disclose only information specifically authorized by the court order, aligning with the principle of minimum necessity.

The principle of minimum necessary ensures that the sharing of PHI is limited to what is essential for a specific purpose, and it is integrated into various legal frameworks, including HIPAA, 42 CFR Part 2, and state laws. Courts can receive PHI under specific conditions outlined in these laws, with an emphasis on obtaining only the information authorized by a court order.

## Methods
In my research, I used a  structured approach to identify and analyze relevant literature about privacy regulations in correctional facilities, particularly regarding the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). To start, I utilized the academic database PubMed, a reputable source for scholarly articles, and we focused on articles indexed with specific MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms. Our MeSH search will include subject headings such as "HIPAA", "Prison", "Correctional Facilities”, "Privacy", "Protected Health Information", and "Health Information Exchange", ensuring a systematic search of the topic.
To ensure the relevance of the articles, we will examine the search results and focus on papers specifically addressing correctional facilities within the United States. This geographical constraint is important as the legal and regulatory setting for healthcare and privacy can vary significantly between countries. Additionally, we will exclude articles published before 1996 since HIPAA was not enacted before that year.

Within the MeSH search, I used Boolean search, a style of search that combines keywords with operators “AND”, “OR”, and “NOT” to produce more relevant and accurate search results. While the “NOT” operator can be used to exclude specific terms from search results, it wasn't utilized in this search because there wasn't a key term explicitly intended for exclusion.

For the presentation of our findings, we will employ data visualization tools, particularly Microsoft Excel, to create informative and insightful graphs that will highlight the outcomes of the staff surveys. These graphs will help us to distill and convey the nuanced insights gathered from the collected data, enabling a clearer understanding of staff attitudes towards privacy regulations in the context of correctional facilities. Ultimately, this systematic review aims to offer a comprehensive and structured analysis of HIPAA and privacy regulations in correctional settings, combining scholarly research with real-world perspectives from correctional staff to provide a holistic view of the topic.

## How do these laws encourage greater participation and trust in the healthcare system through the protection of a patient’s private health information?
* The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States establishes strict confidentiality standards for patient health information. Patients are assured that their sensitive health data will be kept confidential, allowing trust in healthcare providers and systems.<sup>20</sup> 
* Patients may be protected from discrimination based on their medical information under privacy laws. Individuals are more likely to seek healthcare if they are confident that their health status will not be used against them. This is their window of opportunity.<sup>23</sup> 
* HIPAA establishes a framework for holding healthcare entities accountable for breaches or unauthorized disclosures of health information. Knowing that there are legal consequences for privacy violations reassures patients and strengthens their trust in the healthcare system.<sup>5,6</sup> 


## How does HIV segregation increase stigma and discrimination against inmates?
•	Segregation based on HIV status labels individuals and makes their HIV status visible to others. This labeling can lead to the stigmatization of HIV-positive inmates, potentially creating negative perceptions among fellow inmates.<sup>25</sup> 

•	Segregation can undermine efforts to educate inmates about HIV prevention, treatment, and care. By isolating individuals based on their HIV status, there is a missed opportunity to promote understanding, empathy, and accurate information within the inmate population.<sup>23</sup> 


## HIV Staff Survey
One of the scholarly articles I found on PubMed, focuses on HIV stigma in prisons and jails, specifically among correctional staff. The study includes 218 correctional staff members from 32 US facilities and aims to explore their attitudes toward HIV stigma. The study's goals are to provide an overview of staff's level of stigma, conduct psychometric analyses of two stigma mechanisms (prejudice and discrimination), examine differences in stigma attitudes among various staff types, and analyze differences between prison and jail staff.

The prevalence of HIV in prisons and jails is significantly higher than in the general population.<sup10</sup> However, many correctional facilities do not follow CDC guidelines for HIV testing, prevention, or treatment, which can lead to undiagnosed infections and inadequate access to antiretroviral therapy. 

Stigma can be a significant barrier to expanding and improving HIV services in these settings.

This study uses the HIV Stigma Framework (HSF) to examine the  HIV stigma and stigma attitudes among correctional staff, differentiating between prejudice and discrimination. The research identifies and modifies potential sources of stigma among correctional staff to improve healthcare for inmates and reduce the incidence of infectious diseases. The study also examines differences in stigma attitudes among various staff types and settings (jail vs. prison).<sup>18</sup>
15 questions were asked, focusing on prejudice and discrimination. Exploratory factor analysis was used to assess the factor structure of the stigma measure, and subgroup comparisons were performed to determine if stigma attitudes vary by setting and staff type.<sup>18</sup>
The results found that most staff had positive attitudes, but some expressed discriminatory ideas, and a few expressed judgmental views. The study suggests that even the slightest level of stigma can negatively affect inmate behavior and willingness to access HIV services.
While the study had some limitations, it contributes to our understanding of HIV stigma in correctional settings. It also highlights the need for interventions to reduce structural and cultural barriers, improve staff education and training, and encourage inmate access to HIV services.
