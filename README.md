## *Systematic Review of HIPAA and Privacy Regulations in Correctional Facilities with a Focus on HIV-Positive Inmates*

Ivy Zeng

## Abstract
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act is a federal law that was signed into law in 1996. The purpose of this is to ensure the safety and privacy of sensitive health information from being disclosed without the knowledge of the patient. This is also made true in correctional facilities. Inmates have the same HIPAA rights as civilians, like the minimum necessary standard. Covered entities under HIPAA include any health plan, healthcare clearinghouse, or healthcare provider communicating Protected Health Information (PHI) electronically. This paper will review the privacy regulations in correctional facilities and the stigma surrounding HIV. I describe how the minimum necessary utilizes protected health information for intended purposes and under what circumstances law enforcement can receive protected health information. In addition, I will focus on the stigma surrounding HIV-positive inmates and how the segregation of HIV-positive inmates is a breach of confidentiality. Methods used are MeSH search on the National Library of Medicine to identify papers that present data on privacy regulations in prison. We will also use a public dataset on staff stigma attitudes surrounding HIV in correctional facilities and create pie charts displaying results. 

## Introduction 
Healthcare within correctional facilities presents unique challenges between law enforcement, healthcare, and individual privacy. As the United States deals with one of the highest incarceration rates <sup>1</sup>, the need to balance between maintaining the security of correctional institutions and upholding the fundamental right to healthcare privacy has become increasingly critical. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), enacted in 1996, established a framework for safeguarding individuals' medical information in various healthcare settings. However, applying HIPAA regulations within correctional facilities presents a complex and evolving area of concern. HIV segregation in prison systems is known as discrimination and a breach of confidentiality. Not only is it a violation of human rights, but it also breaks the US guidelines for the management of HIV in prison.<sup>9</sup>

## Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)
In 1996, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act was signed into law to protect the exchange of health information. This allowed patients to control who they released their personal health information to.<sup>2</sup> This is important because we want to safeguard our sensitive data. Organizations that do not comply with HIPAA will face penalties, motivating them to ensure privacy. This law creates a standard for all organizations that handle sensitive medical records. The privacy rule, enacted in 2000, sets a standard for protected health information (PHI). In the privacy rule,  an inmate hospital is not required to get authorization or consent before using or disclosing an inmate’s PHI for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations.<sup>4</sup>
Then in 2003, the Privacy Rule became effective allowing patients the right to personal health information and understand how their information is being used.<sup>3</sup>The privacy rule also allowed “covered entities” to disclose and share PHI electronically with transactions, however, this cannot be done without the patient’s authorization. HIPAA could easily be broken by simply entering the incorrect patient’s chart or separating patients based on diagnosis. The practice of separating HIV-positive inmates has been abolished since 2013 with South Carolina being the last state to do so. This act unintentionally discloses the status of inmates without their consent. With the increase in electronic health record use, we need to be careful in how we transmit medical records.


## Covered Entities
Covered Entities, a crucial part of the privacy rule, are organizations or individuals subjected to follow HIPAA laws. These organizations include healthcare providers, health plans, insurance, and healthcare clearinghouses transmitting electronic health information. A decision tool is offered to help determine if an individual or organization is considered a covered entity.<sup>5</sup> Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services provides this tool for those who are not sure if they fall under covered entities. The decision tool contains questions like “Does the person, business, or agency furnish, bill, or receive payment for health care in the normal course of business?” and “Does the business or agency process, or facilitate the processing of, health information from nonstandard format or content into standard format or content or from standard format or content into nonstandard format or content?”<sup>8</sup>

## HIPAA-Covered Entities:
1.	Use or Disclosure of PHI:
* Covered entities may use or disclose PHI for treatment, payment, or health-care operations without requiring individual authorization, except for specific disclosures.
2.	Required Risk Assessment:
* Covered entities are required to conduct a risk assessment to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities to electronic PHI and implement security measures.
3.	When Consent Is Not Required:
* HIPAA permits covered entities to transmit PHI without consent in specific situations, such as treatment, public health activities, court orders, subpoenas, and law enforcement purposes.<sup>5</sup>

## Methods
In my research, I used a  structured approach to identify and analyze relevant literature about privacy regulations in correctional facilities, particularly regarding the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). To start, I utilized the academic database PubMed, a reputable source for scholarly articles, and we focused on articles indexed with specific MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms. Our MeSH search will include subject headings such as "HIPAA", "Prison", "Correctional Facilities”, "Privacy", "Protected Health Information", and "Health Information Exchange", ensuring a systematic search of the topic.
To ensure the relevance of the articles, we will examine the search results and focus on papers specifically addressing correctional facilities within the United States. This geographical constraint is important as the legal and regulatory setting for healthcare and privacy can vary significantly between countries. Additionally, we will exclude articles published before 1996 since HIPAA was not enacted before that year.

Within the MeSH search, I used Boolean search, a style of search that combines keywords with operators “AND”, “OR”, and “NOT” to produce more relevant and accurate search results. While the “NOT” operator can be used to exclude specific terms from search results, it wasn't utilized in this search because there wasn't a key term explicitly intended for exclusion.

For the presentation of our findings, we will employ data visualization tools, particularly Microsoft Excel, to create informative and insightful graphs that will highlight the outcomes of the staff surveys. These graphs will help us to distill and convey the nuanced insights gathered from the collected data, enabling a clearer understanding of staff attitudes towards privacy regulations in the context of correctional facilities. Ultimately, this systematic review aims to offer a comprehensive and structured analysis of HIPAA and privacy regulations in correctional settings, combining scholarly research with real-world perspectives from correctional staff to provide a holistic view of the topic.
